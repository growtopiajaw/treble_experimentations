# How to build

* clone this repository
* call the build script from a separate directory

For example:

* by default, you'll be using build.sh (aka highly customized build-dakkar.sh) for more complex user inputs (in simple terms, more features)
* phh's build.sh & build-rom.sh has been removed to provide userfriendly experience
* you just need to run the script. All setup to start building are already included in this script
* thanks to me, your workload has been reduced :D

```
git clone https://github.com/GrowtopiaJaw/treble_experimentations`
mkdir lineage151`
cd lineage151`
bash ../treble_experimentations/build.sh lineage151 \
arm-aonly-gapps-su \
arm64-ab-go-nosu
```

The script should provide a help message if you pass something it doesn't understand

# Using Docker

clone this repository, then:

    docker build -t treble docker/
    
    docker container create --name treble treble
    
    docker run -ti \

        -v $(pwd)/../treble_output:/treble_output \
        -w /treble_output \
        treble \
        /bin/bash /treble/build.sh rr81 \
        arm-aonly-gapps-su \
        arm64-ab-go-nosu
